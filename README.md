**Technical Implementation Manager → AI Safety**

## About Me

I'm a Data Science master's student at Universidad de Buenos Aires with a background in Electronic Engineering and telecom systems. My professional experience spans network reliability monitoring and fintech implementation, work that got me thinking seriously about what happens when complex systems fail, and how to detect that before it happens.

That question is what led me to AI safety. I'm currently building toward a research career focused on **deployment-time safety monitoring for LLMs**: detecting harmful behaviors in production systems, not just during training.

## Current Focus

- **Master's Thesis (in progress, defense December 2026):** Monitoring harms in LLM interactions — classifier-based detection and internal representation analysis
- **Technical AI Safety (BlueDot Impact) — completed February 2026**

## Background

- **Education:** MSc Data Science (UBA, in progress) · Electronic Engineering (completed)
- **Work:** Technical Implementation Manager at a fintech company — system integration, reliability, and monitoring at scale
- **Previous:** Telecom network operations — SLA monitoring, failure prediction, alarm systems for fiber optic backbone infrastructure
